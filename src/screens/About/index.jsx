          Our story began in 1955. My father opened a kiryana store which was tucked away in an obscure lane in Bahadurabad. In 1978, I made a trip to Singapore and I came across the Al-Mustafa Store, which was one of the largest retail chains there; I was so impressed with their business model that I decided to replicate it for Imtiaz. On my return, we began adding more product categories to our existing assortment and thanks to the favourable customer response, after a few years, we bought the adjoining shops to expand the set-up.
"When Imtiaz first started, shopping for groceries was about buying maheenay ka rashan â€“ rice, flour, sugar, salt, cooking oil and spices. Today, this kind of shopping is not considered a chore anymore; rather, it is seen as a fun, family outing."
